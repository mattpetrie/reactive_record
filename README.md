ReActive Record
==================

A lightweight clone of ActiveRecord's Object Relational Mapping features, employing heavy use of metaprogramming in Ruby.

**Features replicated include:**
* Instance variables
* Model attributes
* Saving and updating of Models in SQL database
* SQL database querying using Ruby (AR's 'where', 'find', and 'all' methods)
* Model associations (belongs_to, has_many, has_one_through)
